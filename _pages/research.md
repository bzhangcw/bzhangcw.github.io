My research interests include:
- Second-order optimization methods (SOMs) and general nonlinear programming.
- Mixed-integer optimization with real-world applications in the industry. 
My research in this track is heavily motivated from the experiences at Shanshu. 
  - See past works with [China Southern Airlines](#), [Jinghu High-speed Railway](#).
- Public-sector operations research, population game.
- Optimization solvers and packages. 
  - I involved in a few linear conic optimization solvers, including [ABIP](https://github.com/INFORMSJoC/2023.0017), [cuPDLP-C](https://github.com/COPT-Public/cuPDLP-C)
  - A julia package of second-order methods, [DRSOM.jl](https://github.com/bzhangcw/DRSOM.jl)

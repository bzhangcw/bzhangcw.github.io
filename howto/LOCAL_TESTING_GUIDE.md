# Local Testing Guide (No Node.js Required)

Since Node.js isn't installed on your system, here are alternative ways to test the Google Analytics integration:

## Option 1: Browser-Based Testing

1. **Start your local server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. **Open the browser test page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/howto/test-ga-browser.html
   ```

3. **Use the test buttons** to check:
   - Environment detection
   - Fallback script functionality
   - API endpoint availability

## Option 2: Test on Deployed Site

The most reliable way to test the real API is on your deployed Netlify site:

1. **Deploy your changes** to Netlify
2. **Set up environment variables** in Netlify dashboard:
   - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Your service account JSON
   - `GA4_PROPERTY_ID`: Your numeric Property ID

3. **Test on the deployed site**:
   ```
   https://your-site.netlify.app/howto/test-ga-browser.html
   ```

## Option 3: Install Node.js (Optional)

If you want to test locally with Node.js:

### Using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install node
```

### Using nvm (Node Version Manager):
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.zshrc
nvm install node
nvm use node
```

### Then install Netlify CLI:
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

### Test locally:
```bash
# Set environment variables
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$(pwd)/howto/sigma-crawler-351008-cff379b5231b.json"
export GA4_PROPERTY_ID="your-numeric-property-id"

# Start local development
netlify dev

# Test the function
node howto/test-ga-function-local.js
```

## Current Status

✅ **What works without Node.js:**
- Browser-based testing
- Fallback script testing
- Environment detection
- Deployed site testing

❌ **What requires Node.js:**
- Local Netlify function testing
- Direct API testing without deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Use the browser test page** to verify your setup
2. **Deploy to Netlify** to test the real API
3. **Set up environment variables** in Netlify dashboard
4. **Test on the deployed site**

The browser test page will help you identify exactly what's working and what needs to be fixed!
